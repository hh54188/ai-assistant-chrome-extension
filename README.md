An AI-powered assistant that works directly in your browser. Chat with AI models, capture screenshots, and use advanced features like Multi-Model Mode for comparing multiple AI responses.

**I built this app because I was frustrated by other apps charging $20 per month for similar features. My Cursor subscription also costs about $20 per month, but with it, I feel I can create a new app with the same functionality every monthâ€”each time with a different twist. Why pay so much for something I can build myself?**

> **Note:** 99% of the code in this project was written by Cursor. I was mainly responsible for review and direction.


> **Note:** I am unable to support OpenAI because I live in Beijing and only have credit cards issued in mainland China, which OpenAI does not accept for subscription payments.  
> If you're interested, you can add support for OpenAI yourselfâ€”I've already implemented part of the code, but it's currently commented out.
