# Store Coverage Enforcer Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the Store Coverage Enforcer GitHub Action workflow, which has been extracted into individual code files for better maintainability and reusability.

## Architecture

The Store Coverage Enforcer consists of:

1. **GitHub Action Workflow** (`.github/workflows/coverage-enforcer.yml`)
2. **Individual Script Files** (`scripts/` directory)
3. **Supporting Documentation**

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Analyze Coverage Data (`scripts/analyze-coverage-data.js`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes coverage data from lcov.info files to determine current coverage percentages.

**Features**:
- Parses lcov.info coverage files
- Calculates overall coverage percentages (lines, functions, branches)
- Identifies files with incomplete coverage
- Generates detailed coverage analysis report
- Sets GitHub Actions outputs for downstream steps

**Outputs**:
- `coverage-below-100`: Boolean indicating if coverage is below 100%
- `lines-coverage`: Percentage of lines covered
- `functions-coverage`: Percentage of functions covered
- `branches-coverage`: Percentage of branches covered
- `coverage-summary`: JSON summary of coverage data

**Generated Files**:
- `coverage-analysis.json`: Detailed coverage analysis

### 2. Analyze Uncovered Code for 100% Coverage (`scripts/analyze-uncovered-code.js`)

**Purpose**: Analyzes uncovered code paths to identify specific lines, functions, and branches that need additional test coverage.

**Features**:
- Parses detailed lcov.info data for line-by-line analysis
- Identifies uncovered lines, functions, and branches
- Generates test suggestions for each uncovered item
- Creates comprehensive test generation recommendations
- Provides specific examples for test implementation

**Outputs**:
- `has-uncovered-code`: Boolean indicating if uncovered code exists
- `uncovered-lines`: JSON array of uncovered lines
- `uncovered-functions`: JSON array of uncovered functions
- `uncovered-branches`: JSON array of uncovered branches
- `test-suggestions`: JSON array of test generation suggestions

**Generated Files**:
- `test-suggestions.json`: Detailed test generation suggestions

### 3. Generate Tests (`scripts/generate-tests.js`)

**Purpose**: Generates additional test files based on uncovered code analysis.

**Features**:
- Creates test files for uncovered code paths
- Generates test templates with proper structure
- Ensures test files follow project conventions
- Creates necessary test directories
- Provides TODO comments for manual implementation

**Outputs**:
- `tests-generated`: Boolean indicating if tests were generated
- `tests-count`: Number of test files generated

### 4. Create Coverage PR (`scripts/create-coverage-pr.js`)

**Purpose**: Creates a pull request with the generated tests to improve coverage.

**Features**:
- Creates new branch for coverage improvements
- Generates comprehensive PR description
- Includes coverage metrics and improvement details
- Adds appropriate labels (coverage, automated)
- Uses GitHub API without external dependencies

**Outputs**:
- `pr-url`: URL of the created pull request
- `pr-number`: Number of the created pull request

├── COVERAGE_ENFORCER_IMPLEMENTATION.md # This file
└── AI_TEST_GENERATION_EXAMPLE.md      # AI test generation examples
```

## Usage

### Running Individual Scripts

Each script can be run independently for testing or debugging:

```bash
# Analyze coverage data
node scripts/analyze-coverage-data.js

# Analyze uncovered code
node scripts/analyze-uncovered-code.js

# Generate tests
node scripts/generate-tests.js

# Create pull request
node scripts/create-coverage-pr.js
```

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub API token for repository access
- `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`: Repository in format "owner/repo"
- `GITHUB_SHA`: Current commit SHA
- `CURSOR_API_KEY`: API key for AI-powered test generation (optional)

### Input Files

The scripts expect the following input files:

- `coverage/lcov.info`: Coverage data file from vitest
- `coverage-analysis.json`: Generated by analyze-coverage-data.js
- `test-suggestions.json`: Generated by analyze-uncovered-code.js

## Configuration

### Coverage Requirements

The workflow enforces 100% coverage for:
- **Lines**: All executable lines must be covered
- **Functions**: All functions must be called in tests
- **Branches**: All conditional branches must be tested

### Test Generation

Test files are generated with:
- Proper import statements
- Vitest test structure
- TODO comments for implementation
- Store-specific test patterns

### Pull Request Format

Generated PRs include:
- Coverage improvement metrics
- List of modified files
- Generated artifacts information
- Automated labeling

## Error Handling

Each script includes comprehensive error handling:
- File existence checks
- JSON parsing validation
- GitHub API error handling
- Graceful failure with meaningful messages

## Logging

All scripts provide detailed logging with:
- Color-coded output for different message types
- Progress indicators
- Success/failure status
- Debug information

## Dependencies

The scripts use only Node.js built-in modules:
- `fs`: File system operations
- `path`: Path manipulation
- `https`: HTTP requests for GitHub API
- `url`: URL parsing

No external dependencies are required, making the scripts lightweight and reliable.

## Testing

To test the scripts locally:

1. Ensure coverage data exists in `coverage/lcov.info`
2. Run scripts in sequence
3. Check generated files and outputs
4. Verify GitHub API calls (if testing PR creation)

## Maintenance

### Adding New Features

1. Modify the appropriate script file
2. Update GitHub Actions outputs if needed
3. Update documentation
4. Test changes thoroughly

### Debugging

Enable debug logging by setting environment variables:
```bash
export DEBUG=true
node scripts/analyze-coverage-data.js
```

### Monitoring

Check GitHub Actions logs for:
- Coverage analysis results
- Test generation progress
- PR creation status
- Error messages and stack traces

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Integration with more AI services
- Custom test generation templates
- Advanced coverage analysis
- Integration with code quality tools
- Custom PR templates
- Enhanced error recovery

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
2. Review script documentation
3. Verify environment variables
4. Check input file formats
5. Test scripts individually
